## Personal Portfolio Webpage of Thomas Tran

## Description

The purpose of creating my own webpage was to have an online resume of sorts. A profile that displays the collection of my career as a full stack developer. As of January 17, 2023, my portfolio doesn't have much to show, so it'll be pretty barebones but we all need to start somewhere.

## Installation

The project can be previewed or be used as a demo through opening the index.html file in a web browser. The provided index.html and style.css files can also be exported onto a registered website. For the purposes of this current project being submitted, the web application will also be hosted on GitHub Pages (link provided: https://tranthom618.github.io/portfolio/)
